== Welcome to the ADC Archives Application

This project is an attempt to provide a web interface to an extensive set of 
scanned  documents forming the archives of the ADC Theatre, Cambridge.

== Getting Started

1. The project is a rails application and thus depends on ruby (>=1.8.5) and
   rails (2.1.0).

2. You will also need to install the 'haml' gem from Rubyforge 
   (http://rubyforge.org) to run the application and will need the 'FakeWeb' 
   gem if you wish to run the tests. Run `rake gem` in the root of the project 
   to see if the application's gem dependencies are satisfied.

3. Run `rake setup`. This will copy scaffold configuration files to the locations 
   they need to be for the app to run. You may wish to edit the database 
   configuration file in config/database.yml.

4. Migrate the database to the latest version by running `rake db:migrate`.

Now you can either run the application's test with `rake test` -- all the tests 
should pass. Alternatively you can go straight to starting the app by running 
`./script/server`. This will start a Mongrel web server running on your local 
machine. Browse to http://localhost:3000/ to see the app.
