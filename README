== Welcome to the ADC Archives Application

This project is an attempt to provide a web interface to an extensive set of 
scanned documents forming the archives of the ADC Theatre, Cambridge.

== Development

The project is a rails application and thus depends on ruby (>=1.8.5) and
rails (2.3.3). To get started developing, you'll probably want to run the 
following commands.

    # if you haven't already, install ruby and rubygems (use google), then
    # run
    sudo gem install rails -v2.3.3

    # download the submodules (mostly rails plugins)
    git submodule update --init

    # the next command may require root privileges
    sudo rake gems:install 
    rake setup

    # configure the databases you wish to use for development and testing
    vim config/database.yml 

    # set up the database and run the tests (they should all pass!)
    rake db:schema:load
    rake

    # start the app
    ./script/server

Now, if all went well, you should be able to visit http://localhost:3000/ and 
see the front page of the application.
